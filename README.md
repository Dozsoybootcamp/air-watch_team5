# Air Quality Visualization Project

## Overview
This project aims to provide interactive visualizations of Air Quality Index (AQI) data across all US counties from 2014 to 2023. Developed by the Air Watch team, this platform utilizes data sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to highlight trends, identify areas with poor air quality, and facilitate public awareness and policy-making.

## Team Members
Debbie Lim, Duygu Ozso, Owen Wang, Rudi Espinoza

## Features
- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize AQI data geographically to easily identify areas with varying levels of air pollution.
- **Data Filtering**: Users can filter AQI data by year and county for more detailed exploration.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The platform updates visualizations dynamically based on user interactions.

## Data Sources
- **[aqs.epa.gov](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual)**: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AQI data by county from 2014 to 2023.

## Tools
- **PgAdmin & PgLoader**: For database management and data loading.
- **SQLite**: For local database storage.
- **SQLAlchemy**: 
- **Flask**: Serves the backend and API endpoints.
- **Leaflet:** For creating interactive maps and visualizations.
- **Chart.js:** For creating chart visualizations.
- **Prerequisites:**
